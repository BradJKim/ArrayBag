# 2400 Data Structures and Algorithms: Bag Data Structure
Completed: 3/8/23, 
Uploaded to github: 11/18/23

Implementation for ArrayBag and LinkedListBag that holds multiple data values in a Bag data structure with either an Array or a Linked List (respectfully).
Also includes a ResizeableArrayBag that will increase storing space if maximum limit is reached by recreating a larger array to store values.

Additional features include union, intersection, and difference functions, which returns a new Bag with all values within two bags, 
only values that are included in both bags, of unique values that are included in one bag and not the other.
